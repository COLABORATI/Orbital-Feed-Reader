## Opml Icon ##

The Opml icon comes from http://opmlicons.com/ where it is offered under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/
I've modified it to not have any blank space and to be just a well-boxed icon. My derivative is available for you under the same terms: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/

## Feed Icon ##
Made available from http://www.feedicons.com - originally developed by Mozilla I'm hoping they are under the MPL but am having trouble finding appropriate info.
