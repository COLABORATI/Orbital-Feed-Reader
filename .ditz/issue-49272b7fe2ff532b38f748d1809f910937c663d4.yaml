    Ok - so looks like we should add a nonce per ACTION. That way we can be sure user is performing the action they intend.  
    Also hearing that wordpress lets you use nonce more than once, which is confusing.

    it's alpha. this can wait till we get some testing.
    hope this doesn't bite me in the ass.
