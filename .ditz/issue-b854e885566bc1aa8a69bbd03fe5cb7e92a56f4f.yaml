title: Set up tagging in the install
desc: |-
  The install should have some sample tags for each feed.
  Should also have a quick entry or description in the intro for what tagging is and how it works.
  The starter feeds should all be tagged with starter feed
  Also we should have tagging on entry of a feed.
  that's a lot of tasks, I should break these up.
