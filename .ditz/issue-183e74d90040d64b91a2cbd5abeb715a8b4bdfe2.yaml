title: Startup experience

  When someone installs the plugin, it should start up with some sample feeds included.
  Every user who has access to the dashboard should have feeds available
  When new dashboard users get created or users are given access to the dash, they should get sample feeds.
  Maybe install feeds should happen on first view of the feed window or the settings window.
