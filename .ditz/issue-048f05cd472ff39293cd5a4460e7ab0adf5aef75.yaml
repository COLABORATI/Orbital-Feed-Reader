    Things we need in this
    1. show a message at the END of the list. - Loading more entries
    2. put a spinner there when we are loading.
    3. when we are X items away from the end and the feed has unread items, 
    then we should add more items to the end.
    4. eventually we may need to add something for the infinite scrolling like linkedin did. As items scroll off the viewport, we would replace them with simlar sized div. Or increase the height on a spacer div.
