title: Style repost things
desc: |-
  From adubs:
  "It would be awesome if I could specify a css class to apply to things I want to repost , so that when I click 'PressThis!', the <p> wrapping the <a> is styled according to that class."
  I don't totally get that, but some of this is due to dependency on the pressthis page/bookmarklet. Maybe we can change what we style.
