title: Set all as read on import
desc: |-
  Man - if you're already reading stuff and you import an opml file, you should be able to import with most stuff already read.
  Maybe you should be able to pick a date and say "mark everything earlier than this read during import"
  maybe you should just say don't import items older than that.
  maybe you should just mark all as read during the initial import.
