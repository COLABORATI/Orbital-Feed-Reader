title: Poll backend to see if feedlist has updated.
desc: |-
  periodically ping back and see if the feedlist needs to be refreshed.
  should we get changed feeds only and then update those by searching on feed_id or should we just grab the whole thing and then iterate?  
  client side shouldn't get too bogged down I think so I guess I'll start with the simple version and see if we need something more complex.
