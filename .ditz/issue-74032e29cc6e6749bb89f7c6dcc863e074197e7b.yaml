title: Deleting a duplicated feed in list doesn't remove from tags
desc: |-
  I had two but does it floats. in list view I choose one and hit delete. Both disappear. Then I switch to tag view. One of them is still there. 
  The refresh of the feedlist shouldn't produce this phantom but does it float.
  Clicking on the feed doesn't pull any entries
