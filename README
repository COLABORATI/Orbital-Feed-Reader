A feed reader for Wordpress
---------------------------

I think that you should reduce the distance between reading and writing. Tumblr, Facebook, and Twitter have all proven the importance of being able to re-share easily the things you love.  Wordpress has a nice "Blog This" bookmarklet but it is just another step to take.

Instead, I'd like to bring a feed reader into Wordpress that lets you blog from your blogroll.

Goals
-----
* Let you subscribe to blogs via RSS or Atom
* Create a blogroll dynamically from your feeds.
* Import from OPML.
* Export OPML.
* Let you share your OPML dynamically.
* Integrate into Firefox as a feed handler.
* Let you mark feeds as Private
* Tag/Categorize feeds
* Support keyboard shortcuts

That's a lot of work to do.  I'm going to take a stab at it, but I'd love your help. Let's make wordpress even better.
